## MastermindSlack

This is a slackbot for a Slack group I'm involved with.  It's written in Elixir
using [Elixir-Slack](https://github.com/BlakeWilliams/Elixir-Slack)

If you run it and have the appropriate ENV vars it will connect.  If you don't,
it will mock you relentlessly [FIXME: Make it mock people]
